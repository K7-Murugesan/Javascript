       <br> Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round,<br>
       flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes,<br>
      cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms,<br>
      onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), which is then baked at a high <br>
      temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.<br>
      A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.
      <br>
       In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced,<br> 
       and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.[2][3] In casual<br>
      settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.
